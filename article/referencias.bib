	abstract = "Deep learning (DL) techniques have obtained remarkable achievements on various tasks, such as image recognition, object detection, and language modeling. However, building a high-quality DL system for a specific task highly relies on human expertise, hindering its wide application. Meanwhile, automated machine learning (AutoML) is a promising solution for building a DL system without human assistance and is being extensively studied. This paper presents a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in AutoML. According to the DL pipeline, we introduce AutoML methods — covering data preparation, feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and neural architecture search (NAS) — with a particular focus on NAS, as it is currently a hot sub-topic of AutoML. We summarize the representative NAS algorithms’ performance on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and further discuss the following subjects of NAS methods: one/two-stage NAS, one-shot NAS, joint hyperparameter and architecture optimization, and resource-aware NAS. Finally, we discuss some open problems related to the existing AutoML methods for future research."

Using latent-variable models with latent interactions, we investigated the multiplicative effect of self-concept and value, which is central to classic EVT. The mediating role of motivation and gendered patterns was also explored. Hong Kong's TIMSS dataset for three cohorts (1999, 2003, and 2007) was used over a period where the education system had experienced considerable changes, providing a strong test of the robustness of these findings. The results suggested: (a) self-concept is more important for students with lower utility values in predicting their educational outcomes; (b) while boys and girls had similar levels of math self-concept and values, girls tended to have higher mathematics achievement and educational aspirations; (c) family socioeconomic status is more strongly linked to educational aspirations for boys."
